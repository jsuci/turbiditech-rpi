Install the required application using the following commands

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ppp


Now we want to configure the ppp interface to communicate with our GSM modem. This can be done using the following instructions

cd /etc/ppp/peers/ 
sudo nano rnet

Then include the following contents to the rnet file

###  File Begin  ###

#imis/internet is the apn for idea connection
connect "/usr/sbin/chat -v -f /etc/chatscripts/gprs -T imis/internet"

# For Raspberry Pi3 use /dev/ttyS0 as the communication port:
/dev/ttyUSB0

# Baudrate
115200

# Assumes that your IP address is allocated dynamically by the ISP.
noipdefault

# Try to get the name server addresses from the ISP.
usepeerdns

# Use this connection as the default route to the internet.
defaultroute

# Makes PPPD "dial again" when the connection is lost.
persist

# Do not ask the remote to authenticate.
noauth

# No hardware flow control on the serial link with GSM Modem
nocrtscts

# No modem control lines with GSM Modem
local

###  File End  ###


Finally type the following command to activate the new interface

sudo pon rnet   


At this point you will be noticing a fast blink rate of network led in our GSM module which represents the GPRS activity.
We can also deactivate the PPP interface if required using the following command

sudo poff rnet
